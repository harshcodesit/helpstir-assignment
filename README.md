<h3> System Design Overview </h3>
The application is a modern web development project utilizing React and Vite for fast and efficient frontend development. Key components of the system include:

React: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces, allowing for component-based architecture and state management.
Vite: A build tool that aims to provide a faster and leaner development experience for modern web projects. Vite serves as the build and development server.

<br/>
<h3>Implementation</h3>


The implementation is structured as follows:

~ Vite Configuration: The configuration file (vite.config.js) sets up Vite with React, enabling JSX transformation and other React-specific optimizations.

~ HTML Template: The index.html file serves as the main HTML entry point, loading the React application into a root div.

~ Package Management: Dependencies and scripts are managed using package-lock.json, ensuring consistent installs across different environments.

<br/>
<h3>Setup and Running the Application</h3>

 To set up and run the application, follow these steps:

~ Install Dependencies:
Ensure you have Node.js installed. Then, run the following command to install the necessary dependencies:

command :- npm install

~ Start the Development Server:
Use Vite to start the development server. This provides hot module replacement and fast rebuilds:

command :- npm run dev
